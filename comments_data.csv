@Randomfoibles,2025-04-07T18:51:28Z,0,"What I understood from this piece is that investor behaviour predicts recession. There are financial instruments to connect lenders with borrowers (Primary). There is also a market where you can sell or buy an Instrument not for the primary purpose but for a secondary purpose. Some people overuse the Secondary (instead of emergency liquidity it is used to make more money (gambling)).
When these Secondary purchases flip the yield curve (note: an yield curve for its primary purpose will never flip) then there is a recession. Sounds very much like a bubble economic system.
If I were super rich and had a few other super rich friends, then I would intentionally take our money out from the system for a while. Make the public panic, ask the government for bailouts and then after a while buy when everyone else is selling. Do it absolutely intentionally, but periodically."

Dont know why my comments are being deleted after an hour or so ...

I follow you and have seen your all videos but For this video I differ from you...reasons being...


1. Trump(Political leader) is God Father of US and to some extent global economic market..

2. His tarrif rise is one of the battle in long trade war...which he may lose in short term but will help him  gain over long time..

3. US GDP will increase next year because he is playing on his strength of economics, trade and dollar power...

4. He has both knowledge and experience of how a business runs..

5. It may seem I am his fan, but he is following all steps which is reqd to help a business grow..

a. Cut costs, dont waste money in global support
b. Cut manpower, remove illegal migrants..
c. Make pacts with rich countries...
d. Charge for rent or increase margin....increase tariff

So it seems he may win this war at the end of 2-3 years...like russia won

That time too people thought it will lead to world war or recession...but result is here

For India, its an opportunity, FII pulling funds is temporary..I think market will recover in a year..."

If the oil companies don‚Äôt lower their prices then the government just orders their newly nationalized oil company to compete against the other oil companies.

@Othique,2025-03-30T14:52:15Z,1,"US American here, I think we all better prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The advice going around certain communities here in the USA is to start getting close to your neighbors to avoid a civil war. Start getting involved in local mutual aid programs so that when everything crashes we can try to help support one another.

I've been trying to get a food garden growing since 2021 because I saw how awful things were going and knew if Trump got back in again he would destroy everything (I believe he's a foreign plant and his purpose IS to destroy the USA so I don't expect any good outcome).

However, I live in a harsh climate with summers so hot it burns plants to death and winters so cold it freezes their roots. Also, I know that if shit really goes down, people in the neighborhood will steal anything we have growing (we live in the city and somebody I live with refuses to put up a fence that blocks the view into our yard). So, I doubt any of my doomsday prepping is going to be effective.. mostly because I'm surrounded by idiots who keep saying ""nahh... it'll be fine"" and every year they're proven wrong.

Don't be like the people here. Expect the worst. If the worst doesn't come, be happy about it... but don't expect anything but the worst.

And start learning a manual trade. I read an article by somebody who survived the collapse of Russia and they said soap become very valuable. So, perhaps learn soap making skills... if you know where to source vegetable oil from, anyway. Or perhaps learn to make vegetable oil."

Just one small correction at 8:58: Long-term bonds don‚Äôt offer high yields because investors are more confident about the future; rather, it‚Äôs the opposite. Long-term bonds have high yields (low price) to compensate for risks like interest rate fluctuations, inflation, and other uncertainties. 
In a thriving economy, investors tend to favor short-term bonds, but if a recession is anticipated, they shift towards long-term bonds, which in turn lowers the yield and causes the so called inversion of the yield curve."

@sharonwinson-m8g,2025-03-28T09:34:37Z,824,"I foresee a recession lasting 2-3 years, and if inflation continues to surge, the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates soon. Inflation is causing various issues worldwide, such as food shortages, scarcities of diesel and heating fuel, and significant spikes in housing prices, leading to a potential financial market crash. This global downturn could have long-lasting repercussions. Given the current inflation rate of approximately 9%, my main worry is how to optimize my savings and retirement fund, which has remained stagnant at around $300,000, yielding almost no gains for quite some time."

This is what will happen : USA clearly understands the power of US dollar. USA wants industrial growth again; seeing how China is crushing opponents and conquering the world (via economic and army strength ), and they are already watching india's growth on the horizon. Since the US dollar's price is too high compared to other currencies, they are unable to extend any industrial growth. Current US government is actually inviting recession with open arms to devalue its own curency to some extent. After short hiatus post-recession, the industrial growth and economic growth will be high in USA, because they already have high skilled individuals, have almost all necessary infrastructure (schools, universities, research centres, hospitals, road network, rails, airports, ports etc ) to withstand the blow of recession (unlike many nations , who will be crippled by recession) and support the growth of industries. Dont forget the influx of a large number of immigrants by democratic government of US; they will provide cheap labor necessary for industries. Gold card introduced by the current administration will attract high net worth individuals from around the world to invest in USA, which is always a dream market for any business personnel plus trump administration has promised to lower corporate taxes as well. 
Outside, the republican and democratic party pretend to have big tussle, but inside, they are all working in tandem for their goal."

@amitkumar-op9fm,2025-03-26T05:51:02Z,0,"Interest rates are nothing but the combination of (Inflation + Credit Risk Premium + Real Risk free rate). In  case of US, we usually consider credit risk premium as zero as no risk while investing in US bonds, moreover, Real Risk free rate is almost constant, hence only variable is inflation. As Inflation is running high in US that‚Äôs why yield curves are negatives. Negative yield curve suggests inflation in the long run will be tamed, however in short run inflation will remain high due to which short term rate > long term rate. So, you missed the main point here my friend üòä‚Ä¶
It was inevitable and expected since 2022 when inflation was running at ~ 7.8% and yield curve was at ~ 3.5% and US government didn‚Äôt do anything to contain it immediately, so whatever is happening is with a lag here. It‚Äôs simple economics."

@srikanthgollamudi2158,2025-03-26T03:06:08Z,0,Actually the yield curve inversion happened in 2022 and stayed inverted for a long time. Technical recession happened which the Biden administration failed to acknowledge. Actually the Buffet index is also another I dictatorship for a stock market crash. To predicate current events a simple yield curve inversion is not sufficient. There are multiple variables like Japan and China selling US treasures and the yen carry trade.

@Lucerne23,2025-03-26T01:55:47Z,0,"The tariffs' effect sounds good in linear theory, however, the overall effects are estimated to be minimal. There are lots of American producers who can pick up the slack. It is not necessary that the prices of consumer goods will rise with tariffs. There is a clear indication of that. Costco has asked its Chinese suppliers to absorb all the tariff costs. Lots of innovation in the US is leading to the production of materials right here. There are several alternatives for the US too. We imported lentils from Africa, Pakistan, and Canada when prices shot up in India. However, what is more important is that the US consumers need to be disciplined by implementing tariffs.  They should stop buying non-critical items from China, which drains lots of US dollars."
@BhaaratChintan_With_VinayaPai,2025-03-26T01:55:43Z,0,"Good explanation. However....
I think you have missed out ONE important aspect. Trump is going reciprocal tarrif way - right? 
What if GOI says - ok...let us reduce tarrifs.... then what happens? 
Can the few things we import compete Bharatiya products, considering the cost of production of American made products? I doubt it very much! 
Parallely, supporting equivalent goods that are produced in India will ensure they remain viable!
ALSO,
The fact that chinese goods will be costlier in usa, is a perfect time to ramp up production in India! 
And let us accept one thing... Indians will willingly work harder - especially at the lower level, than Americans, at a considerably less salary.... We dont need exploitative mechanisms. We can still produce goods that will compete with the chinese ones, in the american market, if we ensure that we adopt a conciliatory approach... 
I'm sure you can work the tactics through...."

@pratikmurari8182,2025-03-25T17:52:41Z,55,"14:00 You explained the issue with tariffs well, but there‚Äôs a darker side to them. For example:

Suppose there are two trucks, one American-made costing 150 and one Chinese-made costing 100.

If the U.S. imposes a tariff to make the Chinese truck more expensive (say, raising its price to $250), the goal is to protect local businesses.

However, instead of innovating, the American truck company might simply raise its own price to $200, knowing consumers now have fewer alternatives.

Over time, this reduces competition, encourages monopolistic behavior, and leads to higher prices (inflation)‚Äîultimately hurting consumers."

@Faraz-cse,2025-03-25T16:33:47Z,6,"14:00 India also introduced tariffs during pandemic, why didn't stock market take a hit then ?

I remember a 7k smartphone (Realme C3) price was hiked to 10.5k within 6 months of Launch. That was 33% price increase. All the smartphones have been a little expensive since then.

Infact every electronic kept becoming more expensive. What didn't no one panic in India."

@ramtejamaddala3259,2025-03-25T16:19:09Z,10,"Talking about employment, wages, consumption and industrial production as pillars to evaluate recession, it feels like India has been on a real recession in the past 1-3 yrs even if it's yield curved or other economic chats don't technically indicate it.
Maybe there was no real fall, more of a stagnation. But take inflation into account and I think it definitely suggests a fall."

@Jay...777,2025-03-25T15:54:33Z,32,"What we are seeing now is the breakdown of the Neoliberal ideology & its policy structures, begun in the 70's when Wall St took over Government.
50 years on & none of the fiscal & monetary levers of Neoliberalism are having much effect anymore.
Interest rates are becoming impotent ‚Äì 0% offers no stimulus.  Any fiscal stimulus must be ever bigger to have little to no effect, other than boost inflation.  All debts rapidly grow ever greater.  Ditto inequality.  Tax cuts for the rich go straight into off-shore accounts, share buybacks & pre-existing asset acquisitions, not production.  Financialization produces nothing.  The Empire is becoming too expensive, not financially but too expensive for its hollowed out industrial base.  Populations have to be censored, monitored & constantly fed lies.  Sanctions have become the dollars worst enemy.  The trillion dollar military is no longer feared, even by the poorest nations on earth.  I could go on, but it looks to me like a busted flush.  Only rich rent seekers love all this Neoliberal garbage, the tech bros lead the pack.  
The system is frozen, locked in decline, forever-war the only answer.  Short cut to the ultimate question of our nuclear Anthropocene age:  Will these wealthy parasites kill the host?"
